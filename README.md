Project: WhatsApp Chat Analyzer

Author: Yusuf Saquib

Date Created: 30 April 2019

Libraries Used:
xlsxwriter for Excel writing
Re for pattern matching

This is a simple Python script that goes through your exported whatsapp texts (only works for Android at the moment) and exports data
into an excel file. Data such as "Most Used Words", "Most Used Emojis", "Total Messages" and "Number of Texts Sent per Time of Day"
are all displayed in the excel file allowing the user to create a graph of the data.

This was made over a few days of on and off work after final exams. I made this mainly because I was curious to see the words and emoji I used most with 
some close friends.
